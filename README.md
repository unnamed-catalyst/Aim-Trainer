# Naef's Aim Trainer
An aim trainer I made using Pygame, which is a set of modules written in the Python programming language, used for writing video games. Most of the images for the game were made using the sprite editor, Aseprite.

## How to install
(Instructions for Windows)
1.	Download and install Python 3
2.	Check to make sure PIP is installed
3.	Install pygame by running the following code on Command Prompt  
  `pip3 install pygame`
4.	Download the source code as well as the uagame module file from the repository and run the file named ‘Aim Trainer.py’ just as any other Python script  file

## How to play
The game is just like any other aim trainer. Multiple balls appear on the screen and the aim of the game is to click on as many balls as possible in 60 seconds. Every time the user clicks on a ball successfully, 100 points are added to the user's score. However, whenever the user incorrectly clicks outside the ball, 20 points are deducted from their score. The user can change their sensitivity if preferred through the Options Menu.
